This is a personal website I have preapared for one of my courses I took
when I was in the computer education and educational technology department,
back in the Spring of 2014. We were asked to use just HTML and CSS for the course,
but I wanted to try out the Javascript, too, which was fairly new to me back then.

Since it was prepared on 2014, it uses the technology of those times. Especially
the Javascript code might be outdated. Similarly, since CSS transitions were not
available at that time, such effects had been achieved through Javascript.

## Interesting Features

Some of the features I had implemented to that website are, I believe, noteworthy:

1) Responsiveness of the layout as the browser width decreases.
2) User experience and interface goodies:
    - E-mail text gets selected as a whole when clicked anywhere on them.
    - Pictures have drop shadows when hovered.
    - Pages fade in and out when switched, through Javascript, in a non-blocking manner.
3) Innovative and breakthrough picture-roll viewer:
    - As every common viewer, displayed as a modal dialog, dismissed when clicked outside, etc., written all from scratch.
    - **Sliding accross the pictures with touch, allows you to swipe multiple pictures without repeatedly releasing and re-sliding!**
    - Pre-loading of images, to reduce/eliminate the delay in loading them as they are requested!

I remember being especially proud about the last two items. Most of those,
however, were not put into evaluation, since Javascript techniques and skills were not
a part of this assignment.
